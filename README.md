# ColorName.ir 

![any-audio-finder-cover](screenshot/screenshot.jpg)

ColorName.ir is an open-source web application developed with Compose for Web, a reactive web UI framework for Kotlin, based on Google's modern toolkit and brought to you by JetBrains. 

This website is designed to provide the user with the name of a specific color in both English and Farsi. Simply pick a color and the application will return the corresponding name for the color in both languages.

I am looking for contributors to help me add more colors and fix existing ones. The UI was designed by https://dribbble.com/Atiyeh-rzv (Atiyeh Razavi).
